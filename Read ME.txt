No longer need to edit JS code.  Use case module to set/clear holidays that are derived from the JS code. 
The 3 modules, the case, set, and clear modules can be moved to parent IVRs for cases where varying 
BU’s have different holidays (i.e. integrators, etc).  Test Holiday now defaults to 12/25/2022.  This can
be overridden to any date by passing in TestMode to true and testDate to date you wish to test (typically set
in parent IVR or initiating campaign.

 
The observed Input value can now be set to 1 of 3 conditions. 
0 – Only actual holidays are set 
1 – Actual and observed holidays are set (Friday prior to Saturday and Monday following Sunday). 
2 – only Monday following Sunday is set to accommodate customer that are open on Saturdays and 
	and don’t observe on Fridays.
